# Write code below ðŸ’–
'''
Create a grades.py program that checks whether a grade is above or below 55.
Start by creating a variable called grade and give it a value between 0-100.
Write a if/else statement for the following:
If grade is greater than or equal to 55, then print "You passed."
Else, print "You failed."
After you run the code, change grade's value and rerun it. Do this a few times to make sure it's working as intended.

# Generating a random number between 0 and 100 (inclusive)
#Inclusive" means that the range includes both the lower and upper limits.
#For example, if you're generating a random number between 0 and 100 inclusively:
#The possible numbers include 0, 100, and all integers in between.

grade=random.randint(0,100)
if grade >= 55:
   print("Passed")
else:
   print("Failed")
