# Functions
As our code gets longer and longer, you might find yourself copying and pasting a particular code block in different parts of the program. That's no good!

‚ÄúDon't Repeat Yourself‚Äù (DRY) is a principle in software development aimed at reducing repetition and writing good clean code. Functions play a big part.

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. To execute this block of code, you just need to know the function's name, followed by a pair of parenthesis ( ).

Whether the task is five or twenty lines of code, you can throw it in a function and use it later anywhere in your program. It takes a little more effort initially but will save you a lot of time in the long term.

Plot twist! In this course, we have been using functions all along. üß©

Built-in functions are 68 functions that come with the Python interpreter available for use. Here are some that you might recognize:

print()
input()
len()
We've used them before, but didn't get into how they work behind the scenes.

And that's okay! This is the beautiful part about built-in functions. Like a car, you don't need to know what's underneath the hood to operate it.

Let's look at some built-in Python functions!

Instructions
Create a dry.py program and check out the complete list of built-in functions:

Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.
Use each of these once in the program.

For the new function, try to read the documentation (üòµ‚Äçüí´) or Google it (üëç)!

Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.

import random

list_of_foods = ['celery', 'broccoli', 'cabbage']

# This was the first function introduced in the course
print('Hello, World!')

# This function calculates the maximum of two numbers a and b
print(max(3, 5))

# This function calculates the minimum of two numbers a and b
print(min(-1, 7))

# This function calculates the length of a list
print(len(list_of_foods))

# This function calculates a to the power b
print(pow(2, 6))
