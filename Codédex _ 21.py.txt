# Congrats!
You've made it to the end of this chapter! Let's do a recap. ü•≥

The while loop iterates over and over again while the condition is true

while coffee  1
  print('tired')

The for loop and the range() function to iterate for a certain number of times

for i in range(10)
  print(i)

Now let's take your learnings to the test!

Instructions
Fizz Buzz is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies. üêù



Though this challenge may appear simple to experienced coders, it is designed to weed out 90% of job candidates who cannot apply their coding knowledge to a new problem creatively. Want to give it a try

Create a fizz_buzz.py program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

Here's the catch

For multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number.
For multiples of 5, print Buzz instead of the number.
Here's the tricky part For multiples of 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.

#code

for i in range(1,101)
  if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0
       print(FizzBuzz)
  elif i % 3 == 0
       print(Fizz)
  elif i % 5 == 0
       print(Buzz)
  else
    print(i)
