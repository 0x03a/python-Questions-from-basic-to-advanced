We just got home from a trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡´ Colombian pesos
ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª Peruvian soles
ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· Brazilian reais
Create a currency.py program that asks the user for the amount they have in pesos, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

Make sure to Google the current exchange rates!

#To convert an amount in another currency into USD, you use the formula:
# AmountÂ inÂ USD= AmountinLocalCurrency/ExchangeRate 
# you can check current exchange rate from google


pesos=int(input("What do you left in pesos ? ")) 
soles=int(input("What do you left in soles ? "))
reais=int(input("What do you left in reais ? "))
sum1=pesos/0.00023
sum2=soles/0.27
sum3=reais/0.16
total=sum1+sum2+sum3
print(total)
